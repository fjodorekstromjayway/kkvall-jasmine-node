Pre-requisites:
To be able to use this project you need git and node.js installed on your computer.
Get them here:
	http://git-scm.com/

Start the project
Let's try to start up the project. In your terminal, navigate to the project root and type "npm install" to install the project dependencies.

When everything is installed, type "node app.js".
If everything goes well you should see something like this:
	"Express server listening on port 3000"

If you get some kind of error, make sure you've installed node.js correctly and no other webserver is running on the same port.

Now try to type "jasmine-node public/spec/"
If everything gos well  you con start to test now. 

For the moment we have nothing else than a page with two buttons. Let's try to create something.

Open up the project in your favourite text editor.
